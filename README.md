# FACIAL-MOOD-DETECTION-SYSTEM-Python-OpenCV-CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a facial mood detection system that identifies human emotions from facial images using Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques. The system detects faces using OpenCV and classifies facial expressions into seven distinct emotion categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CK+ dataset.

🎯 Problem Statement

Automated recognition of human emotions from facial expressions has applications in human–computer interaction, mental health analysis, and intelligent systems. The goal of this project is to build an efficient and accurate facial emotion classifier using CNNs combined with OpenCV-based face detection.

🧠 Emotions Classified

Happy

Sad

Angry

Fear

Disgust

Surprise

Neutral
