# FACIAL-MOOD-DETECTION-SYSTEM-Python-OpenCV-CNN
This project focuses on building a mood detection system using only the OpenCV library. The project will involve detecting faces in images from the CK Plus dataset and classifying their expressions into seven distinct mood categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry), demonstrating fundamental computer vision techniques.
